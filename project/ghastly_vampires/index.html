                                This map was developed by Cubecraft Games as it's 2021 seasonal Halloween map. The map features a haunted build along with two themed entities.

                        Ghastly Vampires is a Halloween themed survival spawn that features two custom entities——a vampire and an exploding pumpkin, an explorable haunted castle, and a set of four accompanying themed skins. It was released in October of 2021.

                    <p class="text5" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                        This was the first project I worked on at Cubecraft and I did the behaviors and particles for both entities. When I started on the project every other aspect was complete or nearly complete.
                        This meant there was a bit of a time crunch to finish the behaviors quickly so we could get the project into QA to be able to guarantee it was ready for Halloween.   
                    </p>
                    <p class="text5" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                        The Ghastly Pumpkin was a simple entity; they slowly crept around their pumpkin patches waiting for an unsuspecting player to wander upon them. They'd then run down the player before exploding in a pumpkin-ee cloud. From a technical standpoint they were a standard derivitate of a creeper, albeit ones with more flair.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text5">
                        The Ghastly Vampire was a more complex entity. They had two states. At high health the Ghastly Vampire would float after the player at high speeds while taking swipes at them. Once the entity got low, it would drop to a slow crawl and lunge at the player if they got too 
                        close. If they weren't finished off in their crawling state they would eventually heal until they could float again.
